oscilloscope
============

Simple Arduino oscilloscope software to examine low-frequency (0.5-1kHz tops) periodic signals. Works only under GNU/Linux. Code is hardcoded to work with the arduino duemilanove board, but it may work just right for other models. Under debian, it requires the following packages:
- arduino-core
- arduino-mk
- python-serial
- python-numpy
- python-scipy
- python-matplotlib

To build the firmware and upload it to the arduino board, issue the following commands:
$ make
$ make upload

To check a periodic signal start the python script:
$ python periodic_signal_display.py

To read any other signal, use the Oscilloscope.read() method. It returns pairs of (time, readout).
